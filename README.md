# blood_bank_management_system
## Introduction :
Access to safe and sufficient blood is a cornerstone of modern healthcare. In emergency situations, trauma cases, surgeries, or chronic illnesses like thalassemia and cancer, the need for blood becomes urgent and life-critical. However, blood bank operations in many regions still rely on manual processes and fragmented data systems, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies.
In real life scenario facilities like hospitals,clinic do not store blood.Sometimes they recommend facilities,organization to the patients.Patients manage blood on their own.This confuses the patients more than they are already in.All of a sudden they have to manage blood from nowhere.Most of the patients manages blood from relatives.Some gets help from organizations.
So we suggest a website to help people.We developed a comprehensive Blood Bank Management System - a full-stack web application combining PHP, MySQL, JAVAScript and responsive CSS design. This platform connects potential blood donors, hospitals, and patients in a centralized system, offering real-time updates, secure records, and an intuitive interface.
Using this website facilities can store information of blood donors,receivers,emergency contacts.When patients get admitted in a facility they can go to the facilities website and access necessary information.
In this website patients can easily search for emergency donors contact,available blood stocks,other facilities blood stocks.
Facility authorities can update the information stored in their database.Dedicated Blood Bank can implement/integrate this website and database with their own .Admin can record blood receive event,donation event .After that the website will automatically update the blood stock in their facility.Anyone can register as user.Users can donate/receive blood,set their status as emergency donor,search for blood,filter donor according to locations.
